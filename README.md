<h3>What is TimeMe.js?</h3>
TimeMe.js is a JavaScript library that accurately tracks how long users interact with a web page.
TimeMe.js disregards time spent on a web page if the user minimizes the browser or 
switches to a different tab.  This means a more accurate reflection of actual 'interaction' time by 
a user is being collected.  Additionally, TimeMe.js disregards 'idle' time outs.  If the user goes 
idle (no page mouse movement, no page keyboard input) for a customizable period of time,
then TimeMe.js will automatically ignore this time.  This means no time will be reported
where a web page is open but the user isn't actually interacting with it (such as when
they temporarily leave the computer).  These components put together create a much more accurate
representation of how long users are actually using a web page.

Furthermore - TimeMe tracks time usage across multiple pages.  This is particularly 
useful when running a single page web application. You can get a list of all aggregate 
times spent on all pages from TimeMe.js.

<h3>Demo</h3>
You can see a demo of a timer using TimeMe.js

<h3>Where do I get TimeMe.js?</h3>
You can use Bower to install TimeMe (see next steps) and its dependencies.
Alternatively, you can download the most recent copy at <a href="https://github.com/jasonzissman/TimeMe.js">the TimeMe Github project</a>.
Notice you will also need a copy of <a href="https://github.com/serkanyersen/ifvisible.js">
Serkanyersen's ifvisible.js project</a>. The ifvisible.js library is REQUIRED to allow
TimeMe.js to work.

<h3>How do I use TimeMe.js?</h3>

First, obtain a copy of timeme.js and ifvisible.js.  You can get both by installing TimeMe.js via Bower: <br/><br/>
<div class="code-block"><pre><code>bower install timeme.js</pre></code></div><br/><br/>
Then, simply include the following lines of code in your page's head element: <br/><br/>
<div class="code-block"><pre><code>&lt;script src="ifvisible.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="timeme.js"&gt;&lt;/script"&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript""&gt;
	TimeMe.setIdleDurationInSeconds(30);
	TimeMe.setCurrentPageName("my-home-page");
	TimeMe.initialize();		
&lt;/script"&gt;</code></pre>
</div><br/>
This code both imports the TimeMe.js library and initializes it.  Notice that
this code sets the idle duration to 30 seconds, which means 30 seconds of user
inactivity (no mouse or keyboard usage on the page) will stop the timer.  Also,
we define a page name (my-home-page) to associate with the current timer.
<br/><br/>
Once imported and initialized, we can call the various methods made available
by TimeMe.js.  See the <a href="#API">API documentation</a> below for
a complete breakdown of all of the available functionality.  The most basic
feature is to retrieve the time spent by the user on the current page:<br/><br/>
<div class="code-block">
	<pre><code>var timeSpentOnPage = TimeMe.getTimeOnCurrentPageInSeconds();</code></pre>
</div><br/>
In most cases you will want to store the time spent on a page for analytic purposes.  You will
therefore need to send the time spent on a page to the server at some point!  When is
the best time to do this?  You can hook into the window.onbeforeunload event to do so.
In most browsers this method is fired during a page's shut-down routine.
Notice below that we use a synchronous request (not the usual asynchronous request) to guarantee
the request to our server arrives before the page closes:<br/><br/>
<div class="code-block">
<pre><code>window.onbeforeunload = function (event) {
	xmlhttp=new XMLHttpRequest();
	xmlhttp.open("POST","ENTER_URL_HERE",false);
	xmlhttp.setRequestHeader("Content-type", "application/x-www-form-urlencoded");
	var timeSpentOnPage = TimeMe.getTimeOnCurrentPageInSeconds();
	xmlhttp.send(timeSpentOnPage);
};</code></pre>
</div><br/>
Using 'onbeforeunload' is by no means a requirement.  You can hook into any other event
or logical point in your application to send the time spent information to the server.
<br/><br/>
In a traditional web design where one static page is served for each request
made by the client, any call to getTimeOnCurrentPageInSeconds() will be
unique and valid for each page that imports and initializes TimeMe.js. Alternatively,
if using a Single Page Application (SPA) design, TimeMe.js can have its timer stopped,
page name switched, and the timer resumed (for the new page) with the following calls:<br/><br/>
<div class="code-block">
<pre><code>TimeMe.stopTimer();
// ... Now might be a good time to upload the time spent on the page to your server!
// ... load up new page
TimeMe.setCurrentPageName("new-page-name");
TimeMe.startTimer();</code></pre>
</div><br/>
All page times are tracked in TimeMe.js, so you can review total aggregate time
spent on each page for a particular user's session:<br/><br/>
<div class="code-block">
<pre><code>var timeSpentReport = TimeMe.getTimeOnAllPagesInSeconds();</code></pre>
</div><br/>
This call will return an array of objects of page names and the corresponding aggregate
time spent on that page.

<h3>What browsers are supported?</h3>
Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and IE 8+.

<h3>Anyone to give credit to?</h3>
TimeMe.js uses ifvisible.js.  Take a look at 
<a href="https://github.com/serkanyersen/ifvisible.js">serkanyersen's Github account</a> 
if interested in just using the 'ifvisible' component of TimeMe that lets you know when a 
user is actively viewing your page!

<h3>API</h3>	
<div class="code-block">
<pre><code>TimeMe.setCurrentPageName(newPageName);</code></pre>

turned off.
<br/><br/>
</div><br/>		
<div class="code-block">
<pre><code>TimeMe.initialize();</code></pre>
Initializes the timer.  Should only be called when first importing the
library and beginning to time page usage.
<br/><br/>
