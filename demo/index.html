			<h3>Demo</h3>
			Notice the timer above?  It is tracking how long you are actively viewing this web page.
			It is smart enough to stop incrementing when you minimize the browser or if you switch to
			a different tab.  Try it out!  It also stops incrementing if you go idle for more than 15
			seconds (meaning you don't move the mouse or enter the keyboard for 15 seconds).  While 15
			seconds is a relatively short time to gauge inactivity, it can be increased to a more
			realistic value (such as 60 seconds) to determine that a user is no longer viewing the page
			and has left the browser or computer altogether.
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>TimeMe.js</h3>
			TimeMe.js is a JavaScript library that accurately tracks how long users interact with a web page.
			TimeMe.js disregards time spent on a web page if the user minimizes the browser or 
			switches to a different tab.  This means a more accurate reflection of actual 'interaction' time by 
			a user is being collected.  Additionally, TimeMe.js disregards 'idle' time outs.  If the user goes 
			idle (no page mouse movement, no page keyboard input) for a customizable period of time,
			then TimeMe.js will automatically ignore this time.  This means no time will be reported
			where a web page is open but the user isn't actually interacting with it (such as when
			they temporarily leave the computer).  These components put together create a much more accurate
			representation of how long users are actually using a web page.
			<br/><br/>
			Furthermore - TimeMe tracks time usage across multiple pages.  This is particularly 
			useful when running a single page web application. You can get a list of all aggregate 
			times spent on all pages from TimeMe.js.

		<div>
			<h3>Where do I get TimeMe.js?</h3>
			Simply use Bower to install the TimeMe.js package and its dependencies:<br/><br/>
			<div class="code-block"><pre><code>bower install timeme.js</code></pre>
			</div><br/>			
			
			Alternatively, you can download the most recent copy at <a href="https://github.com/jasonzissman/TimeMe.js">the TimeMe Github project</a>.
			Notice you will also need a copy of <a href="https://github.com/serkanyersen/ifvisible.js">
			Serkanyersen's ifvisible.js project</a>.
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>How do I use TimeMe.js?</h3>
			Simply include the following lines of code in your page's head element: <br/><br/>
			<div class="code-block"><pre><code>&lt;script src="ifvisible.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="timeme.js"&gt;&lt;/script"&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript""&gt;
	TimeMe.setIdleDurationInSeconds(30);
	TimeMe.setCurrentPageName("my-home-page");
	TimeMe.initialize();		
&lt;/script"&gt;</code></pre>
			</div><br/>
			This code both imports the TimeMe.js library and initializes it.  Notice that
			this code sets the idle duration to 30 seconds, which means 30 seconds of user
			inactivity (no mouse or keyboard usage on the page) will stop the timer.  Also,
			we define a page name (my-home-page) to associate with the current timer.
			<br/><br/>
			Once imported and initialized, we can call the various methods made available
			by TimeMe.js.  See the <a href="#API">API documentation</a> below for
			a complete breakdown of all of the available functionality.  The most basic
			feature is to retrieve the time spent by the user on the current page:<br/><br/>
			<div class="code-block">
				<pre><code>var timeSpentOnPage = TimeMe.getTimeOnCurrentPageInSeconds();</code></pre>
			</div><br/>
			In most cases you will want to store the time spent on a page for analytic purposes.  You will
			therefore need to send the time spent on a page to the server at some point!  When is
			the best time to do this?  You can hook into the window.onbeforeunload event to do so.
			In most browsers this method is fired during a page's shut-down routine.
			Notice below that we use a synchronous request (not the usual asynchronous request) to guarantee
			the request to our server arrives before the page closes:<br/><br/>
			<div class="code-block">
				<pre><code>window.onbeforeunload = function (event) {
	xmlhttp=new XMLHttpRequest();
	xmlhttp.open("POST","ENTER_URL_HERE",false);
	xmlhttp.setRequestHeader("Content-type", "application/x-www-form-urlencoded");
	var timeSpentOnPage = TimeMe.getTimeOnCurrentPageInSeconds();
	xmlhttp.send(timeSpentOnPage);
};</code></pre>
			</div><br/>
			Using 'onbeforeunload' is by no means a requirement.  You can hook into any other event
			or logical point in your application to send the time spent information to the server.
			<br/><br/>
			In a traditional web design where one static page is served for each request
			made by the client, any call to getTimeOnCurrentPageInSeconds() will be
			unique and valid for each page that imports and initializes TimeMe.js. Alternatively,
			if using a Single Page Application (SPA) design, TimeMe.js can have its timer stopped,
			page name switched, and the timer resumed (for the new page) with the following calls:<br/><br/>
			<div class="code-block">
				<pre><code>TimeMe.stopTimer();
// ... Now might be a good time to upload the time spent on the page to your server!
// ... load up new page
TimeMe.setCurrentPageName("new-page-name");
TimeMe.startTimer();</code></pre>
			</div><br/>
			All page times are tracked in TimeMe.js, so you can review total aggregate time
			spent on each page for a particular user's session:<br/><br/>
			<div class="code-block">
				<pre><code>var timeSpentReport = TimeMe.getTimeOnAllPagesInSeconds();</code></pre>
			</div><br/>
			This call will return an array of objects of page names and the corresponding aggregate
			time spent on that page.
		</div>		
		<div>
			<h3>What browsers are supported?</h3>
			Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and IE 8+.
		</div>		
		<div>
			<h3>Anyone to give credit to?</h3>
			TimeMe.js uses ifvisible.js.  Take a look at 
			<a href="https://github.com/serkanyersen/ifvisible.js">serkanyersen's Github account</a> 
			if interested in just using the 'ifvisible' component of TimeMe that lets you know when a 
			user is actively viewing your page!
